# Collections in Java

The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.

Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.

Java Collection means a single unit of objects. Java Collection framework provides many interfaces such as Set, List, Queue, Deque and classes such as ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet.

## ArrayList
ArrayList is a class that implements List interface. The ArrayList class has a regular array inside it. When an element is added, it is placed into the array. If the array is not big enough, a new, larger array is created to replace the old one and the old one is removed.

• Implements List interface

• Maintains insertion order

• Internal data structure is regular array

• Dynamic size

• Allows duplicates and any number of null values

• Can not use primitive data type (int, float, double, string)

• Best for storing and accessing data
## LinkedList
LinkedList is a class that implements List and Deque interface. The functionality and behaviour of LinkedList class is similar to ArrayList. main difference is in their internal implementation. ArrayList uses regular array and LinkedList uses actual linked list as the internal implementation.

• Implements List and Deque interface

• Maintains insertion order

• Internal data structure is doubly linked list

• Dynamic size

• Allows duplicates and any number of null values

• Cannot use primitive data type (int, float, double, string)

• Best for manipulating data
## HashMap
HashMap is a class that implements Map interface. The functionality and behaviour of HasMap is similar to map. That means it doesn't allow any duplicate keys. And only one null key is accepted.

• Implements Map interface

• Doesn't insertion order

• Internal data structure is hash table

• Dynamic size

• Allows no duplicate key and only one null key

• Cannot use primitive data type (int, float, double, string)

• Best for quickly retrieving values based on particular keys
## HashSet
HashSet is a class that implements Set interface. The functionality and behaviour of HasSet is similar to set. That means it doesn't allow any duplicates. And only one null value is accepted.

• Implements Set interface

• Doesn't maintain insertion order

• Internal data structure is hash table

• Dynamic size

• Doesn't allow duplicates and only one null value is acceptable

• Can not use primitive data type (int, float, double, string)

• Best for storing unique data
## TreeSet
TreeSet is a class that implements NavigableSet interface. The functionality and behaviour of TreeSet is similar to set that maintains insertion order.

• Implements NavigableSet interface

• Maintain insertion order

• Sorts element upon insertion

• Internal data structure is red-black tree

• Dynamic size

• Doesn't allow duplicates and null values

• Can not use primitive data type (int, float, double, string)

• Best for storing unique data while maintaining insertion order
